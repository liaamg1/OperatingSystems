/*
Task 17. Implementation of FIFO page replacement
Your task is to write a program that calculates the number of page faults for a sequence of memory references (i.e., the
memory reference trace in the .mem-files) when using the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) page replacement policy.
Your program shall take as input the number of physical pages, the page size, and the name of the trace file, see the example
below:
./fifo no_phys_pages page_size filename
