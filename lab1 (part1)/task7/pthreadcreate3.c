/*
Task 7. pthread_create(), how to handle return values
In Listing 8 (pthreadcreate3.c), we provide a program where the parent thread allocates (and deallocates) an array
of structs of type threadArgs, one struct for each child thread. The threadArgs struct passed to each child
thread should also be used to pass values from the child thread to the parent thread.
Your task is to:
• Add a new variable in the struct threadArgs, called squaredId.
• In the child thread, take the thread id, square it, and return the value. Use the threadArgs struct for communi-
cating values between the parent and the child.
• In the main program, wait for all child threads to terminate, and then print the squared id for each thread (this value
should be sent to the parent thread by each child thread).
